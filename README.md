# coffee_delivery

Coffee Delivery manages the shopping cart for customers of a fictional coffee shop.
This application was coded as a challenge for Ignite Bootcamp from 
[Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) and it is able to:

* List all coffees
* Add coffees to the cart
* Update the quantity in the cart
* Locally store the customer's address
* Show the final price and the delivery fee

## Layout

There are three interfaces: home, shopping cart and order confirmation. Some of them
are displayed bellow in different kinds of screen:
